## üë§ Professional Summary

I am an accomplished Business Analyst and Product Owner with 15+ years of experience leading digital transformation, user-centric design, and technology-enabled business solutions across EHS (Environment, Health & Safety), PTW (Permit to Work), SMS (Scaffolding Management System), Indian insurance and public sector environments. My career is defined by turning complex requirements into actionable user stories, process maps, and technical roadmaps‚Äîworking seamlessly between business stakeholders, developers, and operations.

With proven skills in agile (Scrum/Kanban) product management, backlog prioritization, and full-lifecycle delivery, I specialize in high-impact domains such as EHS (Environment, Health & Safety), PTW (Permit to Work), and Scaffolding Management Systems. My experience extends to optimizing processes for the Indian insurance industry and designing tailored, custom software solutions. I am passionate about engineering robust, UI/UX-optimized workflows that enhance operational safety, compliance, and productivity. I excel at integrating modern APIs and leveraging big data and automation tools to provide actionable insights and streamline business processes, ensuring that organizations meet regulatory standards and achieve measurable improvements in efficiency and risk mitigation.

My expertise is backed by practical delivery: from collaborating with stakeholders and managing end-to-end product execution, to process mapping and optimizing compliance-focused software for EHS and PTW systems.
